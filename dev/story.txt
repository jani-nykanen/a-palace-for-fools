"Beyond the vast oceans there is a great kingdom now long gone. Legends say that gods gave the rulers of this great kingdom all the power and knowledge in the world. The gods had hoped that the rules would use this new wisdom to cure their people from a horrible disease that had come to the island just few months ago, but that had already killed over half of the people. 

But the rulers only cared about themselves, so instead of curing the disease, they imprisoned their gods and used their power to build a flying palace. Some people say that the rulers became gods themselves.

They say that the palace is still out there, flying above the clouds. And consuming the world, slowly killing everything living, making this planet uninhabitable"
