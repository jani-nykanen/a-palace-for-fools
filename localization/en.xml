See that door
frame? It is
a portal that
leads to the
domain of The
Eye.

You need a
blood gem
to activate
it, though.

All the people
are dead. They
died long time
ago.
</chunk>
<chunk>
When The Eye
saw the palace,
she killed them
immediately.
</chunk>
<chunk>
It was robots
who finished
building
the palace.

<dialogue id="npc3">
<chunk>
The Eye lives
in the sky.
She did not
kill her people
because she was
mad.

She killed them
because she was
afraid.

They say The
Shopkeeper is
immortal.

You cannot die
if you have never
been alive in the
first place...

<dialogue id="npc5">

<chunk>
They say that 
The Eye is not 
a god, really.
</chunk>

<chunk>
She is an
apparatus
created by
people from
the past.
</chunk>

<chunk>
But who built
her? And why?
</chunk>

</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc6">

<chunk>
Most of us don't
remember what we
used to be.
</chunk>

<chunk>
We were people,
once. We used
the power of
blood gems to
enter the domain
of The Eye.
</chunk>

<chunk>
We tried to
challenge our
old god. We
failed.
</chunk>


</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc7">

<chunk>
We are immortal.
It's a curse, not
a gift.
</chunk>

<chunk>
We cannot oppose
our god. We can
just... wait.
</chunk>

</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc8">

<chunk>
We built the
robots to
finish the
palace if the
people happen
to die.
</chunk>

<chunk>
However, we also
programmed them
to fight, just in
case.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Some of them
went mad, some
of them entered
the domain of
The Eye.
</chunk>

<chunk>
But just like us,
they failed.
</chunk>

</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc9">

<chunk>
We used that
fire to craft
blood gems.
</chunk>

<chunk>
If you had 
enough many
blood shards,
you could do
the same.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Just be quick,
that fire might
not burn for-
ever.
</chunk>

</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc10">

<chunk>
This is the domain
of The Eye. Some
say this is the
future.

<chunk>
A future that
will never
happen, I hope.

<dialogue id="story">
<chunk>
A long time ago
people worshipped
a god they called
"The Eye".
</chunk>

<chunk>
She watched over
her people and
protected them
from evil.
</chunk>

<chunk>
But centuries
passed and
people thought
they need a
god no longer, 
</chunk>

<chunk>
They built a
huge flying
palace to
rival their
own god.
</chunk>

<chunk>
It was a mistake.
</chunk>

</dialogue>


<dialogue id="ending">

<chunk>
And so the 
old world was 
destroyed and 
a new one was 
created.
</chunk>

<chunk>
A new world 
without
The Eye...
</chunk>

<chunk>
A new world 
without
you...
