<dialogue id="story">
<chunk>
A long time ago
people worshipped
a god known as 
"The Eye". She 
was the only god
they had.
</chunk>

<chunk>
She promised to 
protect her people
with one condition:
the surface and the 
sea belonged to the 
man, but not the 
sky.
</chunk>

<chunk>
Centuries passed 
and people stopped
to believe in their
god. They wanted to
prove that their god
does not exist, so
they built a huge
flying palace.
</chunk>

<chunk>
It was a mistake.
