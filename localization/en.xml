We are automatons,
just like you. We
cannot fight, and
that's what saved
use from the
disease.
</chunk>
<chunk>
The fighting ones
went mad once the
disease struck. 
We call them
zombies.
</chunk>
<chunk>
Since you cannot
talk, you must be
a fighting one. 
But how come you
are not a zombie?

We could have
fled when the
chancellor died. 
He was the last 
of our rulers.
</chunk>
<chunk>
Being royal does 
not save you from
the disease, but
he learned that
too late.

<dialogue id="npc3">

We still don't
understand how
these portals 
work.
</chunk>
<chunk>
We are not in the
past, not really.
This is just...
we could call it 
a backup. A time 
backup.
</chunk>
<chunk>
You cannot alter
the future here,
but you can still
obtain items. It
should not work,
but yet it does.
</chunk>
</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc4">
<chunk>
If you spend too
long a time in
here, you will be
sent back to your
own time.
</chunk>
<chunk>
That's how time
backups work. The
same thing will 
happen if you 
travel too far.
