We are automata.
If you talk to
us, we will 
repeat the same
sentences over
and over again.
</chunk>
<chunk>
However, some of
us have gained...
say, additional 
abilities, over
time.
</chunk>
<chunk>
It's almost like
consciousness.
Almost...

<chunk>
When they gained
more knowledge
they learned to
build actual
robots.
</chunk>
<chunk>
However, those
robots went mad
once the disease
hit them. They
are like zombies
now.
</chunk>
<chunk>
You look just 
like them, but 
how come you 
are not mad?

<dialogue id="npc3">
<chunk>
We still don't
understand how
these portals 
work.
</chunk>
<chunk>
We are not in the
past, not really.
This is just...
we could call it 
a backup. A time 
backup.
</chunk>
<chunk>
You cannot alter
the future here,
but you can still
obtain items. It
should not work,
but yet it does.
</chunk>
</dialogue>


<dialogue id="npc4">
<chunk>
If you spend too
long a time in
here, you will be
sent back to your
own time.
</chunk>
<chunk>
That's how time
backups work. The
same thing will 
happen if you 
travel too far.

<dialogue id="item2">

<chunk>
You obtain
"DUMMY ITEM 2"!

"DIVING SUIT"!
